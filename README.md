## Description:

Welcome to my portfolio. The goal of this project is to create an useful and responsive website. To create a mobile website, we need to utilize the Boostrap applications and incorporate different CSS elements.

The  Bootstrap application helps make sure to have a functional website. I  used the appropriate grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

To have the right validation code in all my HTML pages I used this website: https://validator.w3.org
