# Responsive_Portfolio


## Description

The goal of this project is to create an useful and responsive mobile website. To create a mobile website, we need to utilize the Boostrap applications and incorporate different CSS elements. To make this happen, I create three files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html,` and `contact.html`. 

The  Bootstrap application helps make sure to have a functional website. I  used the appropriate grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

What Is bootstrap:

Bootstrap is a content delivery network. Its free and open-source CSS framework is at responsive, mobile-first, front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. To make a good website as a developer, we need to make sure to have a good  **accessibility**.


To have the right validation code in all my HTML pages I used this website: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
