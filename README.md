# Responsive Portfolio


## Description

Welcome to my portfolio. The goal of this project is to create an useful and responsive website. To create a mobile website, we need to utilize the Boostrap applications and incorporate different CSS elements.

The  Bootstrap application helps make sure to have a functional website. I  used the appropriate grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
